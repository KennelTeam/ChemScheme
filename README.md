# ChemScheme

This _should_ be an android chemestry app which helps students learn chemistry and solve hometasks.

## Current user-features

- Displaying molecula in 3D-view (using libgdx)
- Navigating over screens with different modes
- That's all \_/-@-\\\_

## Current program-features

- Integration of libgdx into android project
- Converting data structure into desired format when changing mode

## Features that are required to be added

- The most neccessary is drawing 2D-molecula and building a molecula structure based on drawing
- Displaying molecula's text formula
- Different 2D modes (like skeleton view and detailed view with labeling all atoms)
